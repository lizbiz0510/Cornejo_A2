HOW TO RUN CODE:
  Open up the ipynb notebook file in Google colabaratory.
  Run the code in each 'code cell' and wait for execution to complete before executing following cells.
  ** NOTE: Classifications and accuracy may differ on different executions of the full KNN script due to use of random sampling in the code.
  
Using KNN with K=23, and 3 features of each book, either reccommend (actual rating of book is greater than or equal to 3) or do not reccommend this
book (actual rating of book is less than 3) by calculating it's L2 Euclidean distance to known data points and comparing labels ('Recommended' or 
'Not Recommended') of the K nearest neighbouring points.
